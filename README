Allows users to create polls which can then be embedded in any page with a
<script> tag. Uses AJAX for voting and retrieving results.

Depends on the following Django apps: auth, sessions.

You will need to copy the directory askmeanything/media/askmeanything to your
site's MEDIA_ROOT or create a symlink.

Sprinkler also requires jQuery v1.3 for the nice calendar widget. If you are
not already using jQuery, you can add the following script tag to your
template for the publish form page:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script>


Templates:
See the test project for how to set up the poll creation page (especially the
'poll_create.html' template).

Template Tags:
{% load poll_tags %}

{% show_poll poll %}
Pass this a poll id or poll object. It will generate the necessary script to
load and display that poll.
