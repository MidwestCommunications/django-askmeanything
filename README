Allows users to create polls which can then be published to any object, such
as a user profile or a site. Implements per-object permissions with authority.

Requires the following Django apps: auth, contenttypes, sessions, sites,
authority.

To configure where polls can be published, set POLL_PUBLICATION_TYPES to a
list (or tuple) of models, given as strings like 'app_name.model_name'.
Defaults to (AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE, 'sites.site').
