Allows users to create polls which can then be published to any object, such
as a user profile or a site. Implements per-object permissions with authority.

Requires the following Django apps: auth, contenttypes, sessions, sites,
authority.

Configuration:
To configure where polls can be published, set POLL_PUBLICATION_TYPES in
settings.py to a list (or tuple) of models, each given as a string in the
format 'app_name.model_name'.
Defaults to (AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE, 'sites.site').

Templates:
See the test project for how to set up poll creation and publication pages
(especially the 'poll_create.html' and 'poll_publish.html' templates).

Template Tags:
{% load poll_tags %}

{% show_poll poll %}
Pass this a poll id or poll object. It will generate the necessary script to
load and display that poll.

{% show_latest_poll_for object %}
Pass this an object of a type from POLL_PUBLICATION_TYPES. It will generate
the script to load and display the latest poll published to that object.
