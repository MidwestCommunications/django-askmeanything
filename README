Allows users to create polls which can then be embedded in any page with a
<script> tag. Uses AJAX for voting and retrieving results.

Depends on the following Django apps: auth, sessions.

You will need to copy the directory askmeanything/media/askmeanything to your
site's MEDIA_ROOT or create a symlink.

AskMeAnything also requires jQuery v1.3 for the poll creation form. If you are
not already using jQuery, you can add the following script tag to your
template for the poll creation page:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script>


Settings (in settings.py):
ASKMEANYTHING_POST_CREATE_URL can be set to a string. This is the URL that
AskMeAnything will redirect to after creating a new poll. The default view and
template are quite unspectacular, so setting this is highly recommended.


Templates:
See the test project for how to set up the poll creation page (especially the
'poll_create.html' and 'poll_post_create.html' templates).


The Poll Model:
The poll model has the following attributes:
    Poll.question, a string
    Poll.creator, a User
    Poll.created, a DateTime
It also has a handy method:
    Poll.get_script_tag(), returns the embed <script> tag for this poll


Template Tags:
{% load poll_tags %}

{% show_poll poll %}
Pass this a poll object or poll id. It will generate the necessary script to
load and display that poll.

{% get_last_poll_for_user user %}
Pass this a user object or user id. It places a variable called last_poll into
the current context, containing the last poll created by this user (the actual
poll object). This can be used to (for example) show the user's last created
poll on their profile page.
